I created this E-Commerce website using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, and TailwindCSS.

This website is a simple design developed for assignment purposes. It includes the following functionalities:

=> Users can log in using their credentials and are redirected to the product page upon successful login.
=> The product page displays items that the user has not yet purchased.
=> A "Purchase History" button allows users to view their purchase history by clicking on it.
